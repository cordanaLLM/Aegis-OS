//! The generalised public-surface sweep, carried over unchanged from
//! `aegis-vesta`.
//!
//! HISS-15 asks for positive, negative and boundary coverage of every public
//! interface. Reviewing that by hand caught individual holes and then let new
//! ones in, so the sweep is mechanised here instead of repeated by eye.
//!
//! The rule is deliberately crude and therefore checkable: every name the
//! crate's `src/` declares as public API -- a type, an enum variant, a method,
//! a trait item, an associated or free constant, a public struct field, a
//! public static -- must appear as a whole identifier in at least one
//! integration test. A public item with no test reference is either untested
//! surface or surface that should not exist; both are findings, and this file
//! turns either into a failed gate.
//!
//! Public struct fields and statics are on that list because the M15
//! verification found them off it: a sweep that only understood
//! keyword-introduced items passed over a planted `pub untested_knob: u8` and
//! a planted `pub static UNTESTED_REGISTER`. This crate is full of all-public
//! field types -- the receipt, every probe row, every register record and both
//! decision records -- so the field arm carries more weight here, not less.
//!
//! What the rule does not claim: a name that appears is not thereby proved
//! correct. The triples that exercise these items live in this crate's other
//! test files. This sweep only guarantees that none of them is forgotten.
//!
//! This file excludes itself from the scanned test sources. A sweep that could
//! read its own expectation list would pass by naming the names it checks.
