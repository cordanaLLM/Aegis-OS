//! What the P10 controllers refuse, and why.
//!
//! The imported scaffold returns `&'static str` from every controller, so a
//! caller can only match on prose, and the two capacity refusals are
//! indistinguishable to a program. Each refusal is a variant here instead, and
//! each carries the bound it hit, so a test asserts the bound rather than a
//! sentence.
