//! The bounded microVM sandbox table (REQ-P10-01, REQ-P10-05, REQ-P10-06).
//!
//! This is the scaffold's `MicroVmController` with the three things it lacked:
//! the capacity refusal is a typed error rather than a `&'static str`, the
//! guest memory size and the `vsock` context identifier are validated instead
//! of copied, and the boot-time literal is [`Unmeasured`] so it cannot be read
//! back as an observation.
//!
//! **Nothing here boots anything.** No process is started, no `/dev/kvm` is
//! opened, no jailer is configured, no API socket is created and no guest
//! kernel is loaded. A sandbox is a row in a fixed array; "running" is a value
//! of [`VmState`]. Which monitor a row names is carried, never chosen for it:
//! see [`VmmIdentity`].
