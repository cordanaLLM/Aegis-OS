//! The submission-queue bound (REQ-P10-04).
//!
//! REQ-P10-04 asks P10 to use `io_uring` so asynchronous sandboxing does not
//! bottleneck the fast loop, and the scaffold's `IoUringThreadCore` stands for
//! that: a per-core pair of counters and a poll that returns a fixed four.
//!
//! **There is no `io_uring` here.** No ring is set up, no file descriptor is
//! registered, no submission or completion queue is mapped and no syscall is
//! made. What survives the removal of the effect is the one checkable rule:
//! a batch larger than the declared queue depth cannot be submitted. That is a
//! bound, and a bound is testable without a kernel.
