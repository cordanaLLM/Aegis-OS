//! A literal that must not read as a measurement.
//!
//! The imported P10 scaffold writes `boot_time_ms: 112` into every sandbox it
//! creates, with the comment "Sub-125ms cold boot speed", and the crate header
//! lists "under 125ms boot and under 5MB RAM" among its standards targets.
//! REQ-P10-05 records what those figures are: **the values are unmeasured**.
//! Nothing in this repository has booted a microVM, and this crate starts no
//! process at all.
//!
//! A bare `u32` field cannot carry that. [`Unmeasured<T>`] is the wrapper that
//! does: a value of this type is a recorded target or a scaffold literal and
//! never an observation, its [`Display`](core::fmt::Display) renders the
//! provenance next to the number, and reading the number is the explicit call
//! [`Unmeasured::get`] rather than a field access.
//!
//! What it is not: a unit. It carries no dimension and does not know
//! milliseconds from mebibytes, so the constant that holds one says which.
//! What it also is not: proof that no measurement is recorded anywhere -- it is
//! the type the two recorded P10 literals use, and `tests/unmeasured_literals.rs`
//! checks the ones this crate declares.
