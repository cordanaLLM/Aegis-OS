//! Which virtual machine monitor a sandbox names (decision D58).
//!
//! D58 selects Firecracker as the sandbox virtual machine monitor for P10 and
//! keeps `QEMU` with the `microvm` machine type as the recorded fallback, and it
//! attaches a rule to both: **every measurement records which monitor produced
//! it, and the two sets are never presented as interchangeable.** A boot time
//! or a footprint without a monitor beside it is not a comparable number.
//!
//! That rule is why [`VmmIdentity`] is a field of the capsule request rather
//! than a build-time constant. Nothing here starts a monitor, and nothing here
//! measures anything, so the identity travels with the request and the register
//! below records what was found on one host on one day.
//!
//! # What [`VMM_PROBES`] is
//!
//! A register of two probes run by hand at milestone M06 on the reference
//! profile, each with the command that produced it and the string that came
//! back. It is **not** a capability check: no test re-runs these commands, this
//! crate executes no command at all, and a host that has neither monitor
//! installed passes every test in this crate. Read it as a dated note about one
//! machine, and re-run the commands if the answer matters.
//!
//! Both probes contradict one sentence in the recorded roadmap, which describes
//! Firecracker as packaged but absent. On the profile measured here it is
//! installed, which is also what `planning/hardware-profile.json` records.

/// The monitors a P10 sandbox may name.
///
/// Two variants, because D58 admits two: the chosen monitor and the recorded
/// fallback. Neither is a default here -- a payload names one explicitly, so a
/// number carried alongside it can never be attributed to the wrong monitor.
