//! The regression gate over the effects this crate does not have.
//!
//! The crate documentation says it starts nothing and isolates nothing. That
//! claim is worth exactly as much as a check that can falsify it, so this file
//! sweeps the crate's own sources for a **named list** of identifiers that
//! would be needed to perform any of those effects, and fails if one appears
//! outside a comment.
//!
//! # What this is, and what it is not
//!
//! It is a regression gate over [`WATCHED`]: the twenty-two identifiers below
//! are the ones a monitor, a `WebAssembly` engine, a ring or a socket would
//! have to name, and adding one to the library without adding it here is what
//! this catches. It is **not** a proof that no effect of any kind is
//! reachable: an identifier that is not on the list is not checked, and a
//! dependency could in principle perform an effect this sweep cannot see. What
//! makes the second half narrow in practice is the dependency set, which
//! `manifest_hygiene.rs` pins.
