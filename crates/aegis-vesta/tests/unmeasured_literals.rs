//! Epic E06-2: the boot-time literal is marked unmeasured.
//!
//! Positive: the three recorded figures are [`Unmeasured`] values, and every
//! sandbox row carries the scaffold's literal as one. Negative: no contract
//! payload carries a measurement field at all, so an unmeasured number cannot
//! reach a consumer dressed as an observation. Boundary: the literal sits
//! below the target it is compared against, and saying so is a statement about
//! two recorded numbers rather than about any sandbox.
//!
//! What this file does not claim: that no measurement exists anywhere. It
//! checks the three literals this crate declares and the two payloads it
//! defines.
